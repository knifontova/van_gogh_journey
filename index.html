          Vincent van Gogh (1853 – 1890) was a painter born in the Netherlands but
          with a rich geography of places where he formed as an artist. Van Gogh's painting can easily
          be divided into periods that relate to the places where he lived and who he was inspired by.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vincent van Gogh spent the first years of his career (1881 – 1886) in the Netherlands and Belgium,
          with Etten, the Hague, Nuenen, and Antwerpen as key places on his journey.
          The paintings of those years are dark, with lots of browns and greys.
          He was primarily inspired by the realist painters,
          whose central theme was the hard work of working people.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1886, he moved to Paris, where Impressionism was born, and Post-Impressionism began developing.
          Parisian landscapes, rooms, and people radically differed from working life's brown and grey scenes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most productive place in Van Gogh's artistic journey is considered to be
          the southern city of Arles (1888 – 1889); many people know the artist for these bright paintings,
          where the riot of color had no limits. The emotionality of Van Gogh's work was tied mainly to his great sensitivity as a human being.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last two places of the artist's life, Saint-Rémy-de-Provence (1889)
          and Auvers-sur-Ois (1890), are associated with the asylums where he tried
          to recover from the emotional breakdown experienced in Arles.
          The paintings of this period are also very vivid, but there is a growing tension in the colors and lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vincent van Gogh died in 1890, a few days after attempting suicide.
